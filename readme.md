Hello my name is Lexis Webb.

1. I am interested in building a restaurant app with booking system. It is an idea that I am new to but I am excited to see how I can design and develop for businesses.

2.I would model the data therough the user routes and functions such as picking a time slot/creating reservation, sending their request, updating their slot, and deleting reservations.

3.My four pages would be homepage, reservation page , success/see you soon page form, and 404 error. I will allow each page to connect to each other so that users are able to have a smooth user experience. I will also create user routes and seed data with the backend routing.

4. I used a font API to make the font and interface sleeker . 
Font api: "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Oswald:wght@200;300;400;500;600&display=swap"
