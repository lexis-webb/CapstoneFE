Hello my name is Lexis Webb.

1. I am interested in building a restaurant app with booking. It is an idea that I new to but I am excited to see how I can design and develop for businesses.

2.I would model the data therough the user routes and functions such as picking a time slot, sending their request, updatign their slot, and deleting reservations.

3.My four pages would be homepage, time slots page , user reservation form, and 404 error. I will allow each page to connect to each other so that users are able to have a smooth user experience. I will also create user routes and seed data with the API.

4. I will  be using an API for menu items.
