Hello my name is Lexis Webb.

1. I am interested in building an e-commerce store app as iy helps me to work o my front skills such as UX, UI, and the front end frameworks that we havelearned. I have a passion for front end design and  am excited to be able to take my time and use my craft. I am also a heavy online shopper and it would be an exciting experience to create something that I am so familiar with a consumer to see what goes into the process of briging an app to life on the front and backend.
2.I would model the data therough the user routes and functions such as broswing/searching items, adding items to the cart, creating a user profile, and logging in.
3.My four pages would be homepage, searched item, user profile, and user cart. I will allow each page to connect to each other so that users are able to have a smooth user experience. I will also create user routes and seed data with the API.
4. I will be using an API to provide searc items to the user.
